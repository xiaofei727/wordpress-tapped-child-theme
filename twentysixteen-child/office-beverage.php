    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>Having a fresh hot cup of coffee is hard to find in the workplace. It is usually cheap and bitter tasting which leads you to go to an expensive café to get the coffee you need and deserve.</p>
    <p>This is why we started this business. You deserve a great cup of coffee at the workplace or special event.</p>
    <p>We offer over 20 different coffee roasts and I know we have a coffee that you will love.</p>
    <p>When you schedule a free tasting we will bring some of our top roasts for you and your employees to try. Once you choose the roast you want for your company that is when we get to work. We start roasting the coffee the same day or next business day. It is a 3-week process to roast and pack your fresh coffee in pre-measured bags. Each bag is made for one 8 cup coffee brewer. This insures the same great flavor with each pot of coffee.</p>
    <p>The coffee equipment to brew your fresh coffee is FREE to you. We will even come service and clean the machine every time we deliver.</p>
